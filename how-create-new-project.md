# How to Create a New Project in Rust (Linux)

This guide will teach you how to install Rust, set it up in your PATH, create binary and library projects, edit the code, and run it.

## 1. Installing Rust

### Step 1: Download the Rust Installer

To install Rust, you need `rustup`, the official tool to manage Rust versions. To download and install `rustup`, follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal.
2. Run the following command to download the `rustup` installer:

   ```sh
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```

### Step 2: Follow the Instructions

Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. The installer will add Rust to your system's PATH, allowing you to use `cargo` and `rustc` commands directly from the terminal.

### Step 3: Verify the Installation

Once installed, verify if everything is set up correctly by running:

```sh
rustc --version
```

This should display the installed version of Rust.

## 2. Creating a New Project

Now that Rust is installed, let's create a new project.

### Step 1: Create a Binary Project (Using `cargo new`)

A binary project is the default generated by `cargo new`. The `src/main.rs` file contains the `main()` function, and the generated code will be executable.

Rust uses `cargo`, a tool to manage dependencies, build code, and more. To create a new project, run the following command in the terminal:

```sh
cargo new project_name
```

This will create a new folder called `project_name` with the basic structure of a Rust project.

### Step 2: Create a Project Using `cargo init`

If you already have an empty directory and want to initialize a Rust project in it, you can use:

```sh
cargo init
```

This command creates the project structure in the current directory, so you can start with an already existing folder.

### Step 3: Create a Library Project

If you want to create a Rust library (a reusable piece of code that can be used in other projects), use the `--lib` option:

```sh
cargo new project_name_library --lib
```

Or for an existing directory:

```sh
cargo init project_name_library --lib
```

The main difference is that in a library project, the code is placed in `src/lib.rs` instead of `src/main.rs`.

#### When to Use Each:

- **Binary Project**: Use when the goal is to create an executable application, such as a command-line tool or a full application.
- **Library Project**: Use when creating reusable code that will be shared across multiple projects. Libraries are commonly used to encapsulate logic, functionalities, or utilities that can be imported into other projects.

For a simple application, a binary project is ideal. For reusable libraries, choose a library project.

### Step 4: Project Structure

The `cargo new` command creates the following directory structure:

```
project_name/
├── Cargo.toml
└── src/
    └── main.rs
```

- **`Cargo.toml`**: The project configuration file where dependencies and project settings are defined.
- **`src/main.rs`**: The main source file for the project. By default, it contains:

  ```rust
  fn main() {
      println!("Hello, world!");
  }
  ```

---

## 3. Running the Project

Now that your code is ready, let's run the project.

### Step 1: Compile and Run the Code

To compile and run the code, use the command:

```sh
cargo run
```

This will compile the code and run the generated executable. If everything is correct, the output will be:

```sh
Welcome to Rust!
```

### Step 2: Compile Only (Optional)

If you just want to compile the code without running it, run:

```sh
cargo build
```

This will create the executable, but it won't run it. The executable can be found in the `target/debug/` directory.

---

## 4. Useful Commands

Here are some commonly used Rust commands and their explanations:

- **`cargo build`**: Compiles the project and generates an executable in the `target/debug/` directory. This command ensures that all dependencies are downloaded and compiled.
  
- **`cargo run`**: Builds and immediately runs the project, combining both compilation and execution into a single step.
  
- **`rustc file.rs`**: Directly compiles a single Rust source file (without `cargo`). This is useful for small scripts or quick testing.
  
- **`cargo update`**: Updates dependencies listed in `Cargo.toml` to their latest compatible versions, as specified by `Cargo.lock`.
  
- **`cargo check`**: Checks if the code is correct without compiling the executable. It is much faster than `cargo build` and helps catch errors early.
  
- **`cargo test`**: Runs the project's tests (if any are defined).
  
- **`cargo build --release`**: Compiles the project in release mode with optimizations, generating a smaller and faster binary in `target/release/`.

These commands will help you efficiently manage, compile, and run Rust projects.
