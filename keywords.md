# Rust Keywords

This file contains a list of keywords and commonly used terms in the Rust ecosystem.

## Tools

- **rustc**: The Rust compiler. Used to compile Rust code into binaries.
  - Example usage: `rustc main.rs`
  
- **cargo**: The Rust package manager and build system.
  - Example usage: `cargo build`
  
- **Cargo.toml**: The configuration file used to define dependencies and project information.
  - Example usage: Define dependencies inside this file.
  
- **Cargo.lock**: A file generated by Cargo to lock the versions of dependencies in the project.
  - Example usage: Should not be edited manually.

- **target**: The directory where compiled files and other build artifacts are stored.
  - Example usage: `target/debug` and `target/release` are directories where the compiled binary is placed.

## Concepts

- **Shadowing**: A variable redeclaration with the same name but different value and/or scope within the same context.

- **Mutability**: The ability for a variable to have its value changed during runtime by marking it as mutable with the mut keyword.
  
- **Ownership**: The memory management system in Rust that ensures safety without the need for a garbage collector.

- **Borrowing**: The process of lending references to data, with strict lifetime rules (`lifetimes`) to avoid memory safety issues.

- **Crates**: Rust packages, which can be either libraries or executables. The Cargo package manager makes it easy to add crates to a project.

- **Traits**: Defines shared behavior across types. Similar to interfaces in other languages.

## Useful Commands

- **cargo build**: Compiles the project code.
- **cargo run**: Compiles and runs the project.
- **cargo test**: Runs tests for the project.
- **cargo doc**: Generates documentation for the project.
- **cargo update**: Updates the project dependencies.
- **cargo check**: Checks the code for errors without compiling it. Faster than `cargo build` since it doesn't generate binaries.
  - Example usage: `cargo check`

## Publishing

- **crates.io**: The Rust communityâ€™s package registry, where crates (Rust packages) are published and shared. 
  - Example usage: You can find and add dependencies from `crates.io` in your `Cargo.toml`.

- **cargo publish**: Command used to publish a crate to `crates.io`. This uploads your crate so others can use it.
  - Example usage: `cargo publish`

## Other Terms

- **match**: A control structure that allows pattern matching in Rust.
  
- **Result**: An enum type used to represent success (`Ok`) or failure (`Err`) in functions that can fail.
  
- **Option**: An enum type representing a value that may or may not exist (`Some` or `None`).

- **Vec**: A dynamically sized collection type in Rust, similar to an array but with variable length.
