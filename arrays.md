# Create and use arrays


Rust has several compound data types that can be used to group multiple values into one single type. 

An array is a collection of objects of the same type that are stored sequentially in memory. The length or size of an array equals the number of elements in the array. The size of an array can be specified in the code, or computed by the compiler.

## Define an array

An array can be defined in two ways:

- A comma-separated list of values, where the length isn't specified.
- The initial value followed by a semicolon, and then the array length.

In both cases, the content is enclosed in square brackets `[]`.

### Rust Example

```rust
// Declare array, initialize all values, compiler infers length = 7
let days = ["Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"];
  
// Declare array, initialize all values to 0, length = 5
let bytes = [0; 5];
```

## Read the array signature

At compile time, the signature of an array is defined as `[T; size]`:

- `T` is the data type for all elements in the array.
- `size` is a nonnegative integer that represents the array length.

The signature reveals two important characteristics about arrays:

1. Every element of an array has the same data type. The data type never changes.
2. The size of an array is fixed. The length never changes.

Only one thing about an array can change over time: the values of the elements in the array. The data type remains constant and the number of elements (length) remains constant. Only the values can change.

## Index into an array

The elements in an array are implicitly numbered starting from `0`. We use indexing to access the elements in an array with the expression `<array>[<index>]`. For example, `my_array[0]` accesses the element at index `0` in the `my_array` variable. The expression returns the value of the array element at that index location.

Let's look at an array named `days` with seven elements:

### Rust Example

```rust
// Days of the week
let days = ["Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"];

// Get the first day of the week
let first = days[0];

// Get the second day of the week
let second = days[1];
```

To access the elements in the `days` array, we use an index that ranges from `0` to the array length - 1, or `6`. The first element at index `0` has the value `"Sunday"`. The seventh element at index `6` has the value `"Saturday"`.

To assign a value to the `first` variable, we use the expression `days[0]` to get the value of the first element in the `days` array, which is `Sunday`. For the `second` variable, we use a similar expression `days[1]` to get the value of the second element in the `days` array, which is `Monday`.

## Watch for out-of-bounds index values

If we try to access an element in our array with an index that's not in the allowed range, the compiler returns an error. An expression like `days[7]` is out of bounds because our array has only seven elements. The valid index range is `0 - 6`. Any index that's equal to or greater than the array length is out of bounds. Any index that's a negative number is also out of bounds.

The following code shows the out-of-bounds compiler error:

### Rust Example

```rust
// Get the seventh day of the week using the wrong index - should be 6
let seventh = days[7];
```

### Error output:

```text
error: this operation will panic at runtime
 --> src/main.rs:19:42
   |
19 |     let seventh = days[7];
   |                    ^^^^^^^ index out of bounds: the length is 7 but the index is 7
   |
```

Because the array length is known at compile time, Rust makes it impossible to build any program that attempts to access the array with an out-of-bounds index.
