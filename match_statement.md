# `match` Statement in Rust

In Rust, the `match` statement is a powerful control flow tool that enables pattern matching and allows executing different blocks of code based on variable values.

## Basic Syntax

The basic syntax of a `match` statement is as follows:

```rust
match expression {
    pattern1 => action1,
    pattern2 => action2,
    _ => default_action,  // Matches any other value
}
```

- **expression**: The expression to be evaluated.
- **pattern**: The value against which the expression is compared.
- **action**: The block of code executed if the expression matches the pattern.

### Simple Example

```rust
let number = 2;

match number {
    1 => println!("It's number 1!"),
    2 => println!("It's number 2!"),
    _ => println!("It's another number!"),
}
```

In this example, the variable `number` is compared against the patterns `1` and `2`. Since the value is `2`, the message *"It's number 2!"* will be printed.

## Common Patterns

The `match` statement can be used with various types of patterns, including:

### Literal Patterns

You can match against literal values such as numbers, strings, etc.

```rust
match "Rust" {
    "Go" => println!("Go language"),
    "Rust" => println!("Rust language"),
    _ => println!("Another language"),
}
```

### Range Patterns

You can use ranges to match a range of numeric values.

```rust
let x = 5;

match x {
    1..=5 => println!("The value is between 1 and 5"),
    _ => println!("Another value"),
}
```

### Tuple Patterns

You can match tuples to compare multiple values.

```rust
let coordinate = (3, 4);

match coordinate {
    (0, 0) => println!("Origin"),
    (0, y) => println!("Y-axis: {}", y),
    (x, 0) => println!("X-axis: {}", x),
    _ => println!("Other point"),
}
```

### Struct Patterns

You can also use pattern matching with structs.

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

let point = Point { x: 0, y: 5 };

match point {
    Point { x: 0, y } => println!("On the X-axis, Y = {}", y),
    Point { x, y: 0 } => println!("On the Y-axis, X = {}", x),
    Point { x, y } => println!("Point at ({}, {})", x, y),
}
```

### Enum Patterns

You can match different variants of an `enum`.

```rust
enum Command {
    Start,
    Stop,
    Pause,
}

let command = Command::Start;

match command {
    Command::Start => println!("Starting..."),
    Command::Stop => println!("Stopping..."),
    Command::Pause => println!("Pausing..."),
}
```

### The `_` Wildcard

The `_` pattern is used to capture any value that has not been explicitly handled by other patterns. This helps handle cases where the exact value is not needed.

```rust
let number = 9;

match number {
    1 => println!("One"),
    2 => println!("Two"),
    _ => println!("Another number"),
}
```

## Benefits of `match`

- **Safety**: The compiler ensures that all possible cases are covered, preventing unexpected failures.
- **Readability**: The code becomes clearer and easier to understand when multiple options need to be handled.
- **Performance**: The `match` statement is highly optimized, often faster than other control flow mechanisms.

## Final Considerations

The `match` statement in Rust is one of the key features that make the language expressive and safe. It enables writing clean, secure, and efficient code by leveraging pattern matching to handle various data types elegantly.
